Wired up FDD to breadboard:
Red is INDEX (pin 8)
Green is DIR SEL (pin 18)
Blue is STEP (pin 20)
White is READ (pin 30)
Yellow is enable MOTOR ON (pin 16)
Orange is DRIVE SELECT 1 (pin 12) [FDD jumper selects it as D1]
Purple is TRACK 0 (pin 26)
Brown is DENSITY SELECT (pin 2)

Power +12vDC is and +5VDC connected to bench power supply

Note that all ines are open collector and active low (TRUE = 0V, FALSE = 5V)
Ouputs need pull up resisters I'm using 220ohm which gets a nive square wave on the oscilliscope.

To start disc:
0. unlatch disc (for some reason if the disc is already in the drive on power on it won't seek track 0 correctly)
1. turn on +12v then +5V
2. latch the disc
3. data should be visible on the read lines and the index lines (!)
4. plugging unpluging the blue jumper shifts the head (use the green jumper to choose direction) 
    - oddly sometimes the head will move the oppositie direction?!

Build firmware with bootloader command hoping to avoid the DFU bootloader starting issues.
Didn't work. Was able to enter bootloader after soldering a jumper onto the board !! Good enough for now - 
should look into getting a STLINK clone - useful for debugging anyway.

Wrote HardwareTimer based code to read a pin - can we do this with interrupts or do we need DMA?
